A meeting between four different artists living in London, Paris and Tehran, different techniques and approaches – brought together by this country, with centuries of culture, most of the time badly known and seen by the rest of the World, Iran.<br><br>
				« Iran’s glory has always been its culture », Richard Nelson Frye an american iranologist, summerize and complexify with these words, the origins and the large puzzle of the iranian culture. With more than eighty ethnic groups with an History of thousands years, from antic Mesopotamia to Islamic Republic, Cyrus, Xerxès, Reza Shah and Khomeini, this culture is rich, diversified and fascinating.<br><br>
				In this contemporary art exhibition, the Galerie Nicolas Hugo wants to show some of the multiple facets this fount of culture has, with the differents artists below.
				Afsoon, born in Tehran during the sixties where she spend her childhood before settling to San Francisco, CA and then London where she actually works. Her nomadic life is reflected in her work where East merges with West and the result is at once familiar and foreign.
				She combines different techniques such as linocut, photography, collage and etching and the result is a rich yet often playful and humorous tableau in which the audience is able to engage and interpret in its own way.
