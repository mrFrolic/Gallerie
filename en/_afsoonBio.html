	<h3>AFSOON</h3>
	<p>
		AFSOON was born in Tehran during the sixties where she spend her childhood before settling to San Francisco, CA and then London where she actually works. Her noma- dic life is reflected in her work where East merges with West and the result is at once familiar and foreign.<br><br>
		She combines different techniques such as linocut, photography, collage and etching and the result is a rich yet often playful and humorous tableau in which the audience is able to engage and interpret in its own way.<br><br>
		The ‘Fairytales Icons’ serie the Galerie Nicolas Hugo decided to show for this exhibition ‘I RAN WITH IRAN’, is a sample of people she admired and dreamed during her childhood in Iran. A meaning of hope, dreams and wishes.<br><br>
		AFSOON is represented by Xerxès Gallery in London and LTMH Gallery in New York and she has been recently showed at The British Museum in London, where two of her works are part of the permanent collection. It is a great honor to receive her, hence it is the first time she is exposed in France.<br><br>
		Afsoon lives and works in London, England.
